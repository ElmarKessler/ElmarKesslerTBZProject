### Project idea:
I want to install an operating system on my laptop and make changes to it and customize it.
I would like to learn how to install a Linux operating system.

### How did I come to this project idea?
I wanted to do a project where I can be creative and do something unique. Since my old laptop is slow, I thought it would be a good idea to make it faster with a new, faster operating system.
Also, I have always been interested in linux and have always wanted to use a linux operating system.

### What do I need for the project?

- Laptop computer
- USB stick
- Ethernet cable.

I already own everything needed and don't need to get anything.

### Operating system options:

- Linux Arch
- Linux Mint
- Linux Kali

### Desktop environment options:

- GNOME
- Plasma
- Xfce

I did some research on the internet and on Youtube.
I decided to watch a tutorial on Youtube for installing the operating system.
