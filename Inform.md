### Project idea
I want to install an operating system on my laptop, make changes to it and customize it.
I would like to learn how to install a Linux operating system.

### How did I come to this project idea?
I wanted to do a project where I can be creative and do something unique. Since my old laptop is slow, I thought it would be a good idea to make it faster with a new, faster operating system.
I have always been interested in linux and have always wanted to use a linux operating system and learn how to install one.

### What do I need for the project?

- Computer mouse

I already own everything needed and don't need to buy anything.
