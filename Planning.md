## Planning

### How did I do the planning?
I first thought about what belongs to good planning.
Then I made a task list so I knew exactly what needed to be done. I also created a timetable and set deadlines for the tasks.
I marked the milestones in dark blue on the timetable. 

### Step-by-step task list

1. Inform, about what is important when downloading a custom os
2. Make a new partition on the storage drive for the new os
3. Make computer ready for dual boot
4. Find an operating system with many options to customize it
5. Download the os on a USB stick
6. Install the os on the laptop
7. Boot the os
9. Do customizations and try different options for the look of the operating system.
10. Test the operating system
11. Download different applications on the os
12. Make final adjustments
13. Test the operating system again
14. Write the final documentation
15. Analyze the project
16. Make a presentation of the project

### Timetable with deadlines
I created the timetable in excel and marked in green and orange for how long I work on this task and try to finish with this task. The dark fields are the milestones.
This timetable helped me a lot to stay on time and work efficient. I think a good timetable is very important for a project. This is why I invested much time in the timetable.

The scheduling worked very well. I made a task list which made it easier for me to work on the project. Unfortunately, I couldn't always meet the deadlines in the timetable because there were problems with some the last steps where I needed more time.
