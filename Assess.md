## Assess

### Reflection:

### What I learned:
- I learned how to install a Linux operating system.
- I learned how to do a project using IPERKA.
- I learned what is important in a project planning.

### What was good:
- I like my timetable very much and I think it looks very good.
- The installation of Linux Arch went smoothly. 
- I was very concentrated on my work most of the time.

### What can I improve:
- I could not always meet the deadlines. I should allow more time next time.
- I could not install the KDE (desktop environment) because there were problems with the DNS and the Namingservice.
- I had the focus a bit too little on the documentation. I should start with the documentation right from the beginning.

### What would I do differently:
- I would schedule more time in the project to avoid stress.
- I would start with the documentation right from the beginning.
- I would try to finish with the project a week before the deadline to avoid stress.
